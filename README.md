# Employees List

## description of the project
- [home](https://github.com/ShazaAllam2001/employees_list/views/home.dart) to show the list of employees (name & salary) 

- [service](https://github.com/ShazaAllam2001/employees_list/services/employee_service.dart) to get the employee data from the [link](https://hub.dummyapis.com/employee) instead of using [link](http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees/) as it gave me (409 conflict error) using [http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http)

- [model](https://github.com/ShazaAllam2001/employees_list/services/employee_service.dart) to put the employee data on the right format
